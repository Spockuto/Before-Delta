Pride and Prejudice opens with one of the most famous first lines in English literature:
“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune,
must be in want of a wife.” This sentence tells us much about the author’s purpose and attitude.
It states on the novel’s main themes: the relationship of money and marriage. It also sets 
an ironic tone. The truth about the “marriage market” was just the opposite. It was single young 
women who did not possess a fortune who were most in want of a husband. There is also humor in the
fact that she uses dignified language to describe a crude fact of life. However, as Austen unfolds
her plot and develops her characters, it becomes clear that she views one’s choice in marriage
as a serious matter. Pride and Prejudice may not be a dissertation about political independence or 
the relative merits of passion and reason—but it's definitely a reflection on what those ideas might 
mean for women's lives.
