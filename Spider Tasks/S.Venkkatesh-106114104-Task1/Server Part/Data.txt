The local yum server was done by copying all the package from 
the RHEL 6 iso with the .xml file to a local directory.
Once this was done ,3 necessary packages where installed using 
rpm and the createrepo package was used to create the repomd repository.
Then the .repo file was created(/etc/yum.repos.d) and edited 
such that it mapped to the local folder. Then the data was cached.
Hence , A local yum server was created.
