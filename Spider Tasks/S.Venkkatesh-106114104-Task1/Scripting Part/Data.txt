The Cron executes the commands stored in Crontab. It was edited
by using crontab -e

In the Crontab file , the first part (time config) was set 00 13 * * *
The command was echo "I am CRON"

Since the output was actual was mailed to /var/spool/ , it was redirected 
to the terminal display by /dev/pts/0 (assuming you are working in 
some terminal).
